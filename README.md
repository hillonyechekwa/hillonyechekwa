<h1 align="left">Hello There :grin:</h1>

I'm a fullstack software engineer that likes sitting wild haired and eyed from too much :coffee: in the wee hours battling bugs. I currently engineer on the web with technologies like Next.js, GraphQL and Node.js, but I also work on projects with Rust and C++. I also write about my projects and other interesting things on [my blog](https://byteism.netlify.app).

FunFact: I'm a pancake ðŸ¥ž addict and i tend to name my projects after pancakes on github. 

If you have a job for me or questions? you can follow/contact me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/HillTheLight), [Linkedin](https://linkedin.com/in/hillary-onyechekwa-9aa08b178) or [my personal website](https://savantv.netlify.app)

Cheers :clinking_glasses:
