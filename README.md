<h1 align="left">Hey Nerds :grin:</h1>

Will code for :pancakes: and money. I'm a recluse, I need both.

I'm an a frontend developer that likes sitting wild haired and eyed from too much :coffee:
in the wee hours battling bugs. I'm currently learning the Next.js 
and Web Animations cos is skipped it when i should have learned. 
You'll see some of the projects here are centered around that and other 
react tool chains like gatsby.

FunFact: I'm a pancake addict and i tend to name my projects after pancakes on github. 

If you have a job for me or questions? you can follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/andonthishill), [Linkedin](https://linkedin.com/in/hillary-onyechekwa-9aa08b178) or [my personal website](https://hillwillcodeforpancakes.netlify.app)
