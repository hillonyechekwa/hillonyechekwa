<h1 align="left">Hello There :grin:</h1>

I'm a fullstack software engineer that likes sitting wild haired and eyed from too much :coffee: in the wee hours battling bugs. I currently engineer on the web with technologies like JavaScript, Typescript, Next.js, GraphQL and Node.js, I'm also learning rust to reach my goal of becoming a distributed systems software engineer and someday a robotics software engineer. I also write about my projects and other interesting things on [hashnode](https://vesbuildsthings.hashnode.dev) and on my personal [blog](https://hillonyechekwa.vercel.app/blog).

FunFact: I'm a pancake ðŸ¥ž lover and i tend to name my projects after pastries.

If you have a job for me or questions? you can follow/contact me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/callmehillz), [Linkedin](https://linkedin.com/in/hillary-onyechekwa) or [my personal website](https://hillonyechekwa.vercel.app)

Cheers :clinking_glasses:
